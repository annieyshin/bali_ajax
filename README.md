E-commerce site.

As they say, "Hell is other people's code", in this assignment a developer picks up and runs away, leaving behind a mostly functioning application. My job was to implement AJAX into this site to update portions of pages without requiring a hard reload.

To set up:

* Ruby version 2.5.0 or above

* System dependencies

  - Uses bcrypt and materialize gems

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)
